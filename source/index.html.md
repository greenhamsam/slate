# Introduction

Welcome to the Appia API. You can use our API to access Appia endpoints, which can query balances and transactions and tell you which of our users are cat people (jk, we deliberately don't know anything about our users).

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. BOOM. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Oh by the way, Simon Dingle has an extremely silly face. ðŸ˜œ

**To be discussed:**
- Should we call "institutions", "platforms"? 
- Should we rather just use terms like "where" (institution) and "what" (asset)?
